# task1-control-panel
The file (TASK 1) is an HTML format that contains an HTML code
  produce us
The main interface
Then format with
  css
I also used
JavaScript
The main interface has 6 sliders for each motor according to its number
motor1
motor2
motor3
motor4
motor5
motor6

  It also has two buttons

Save button

(database-photo.png ) to show the tabel in mysql

(database file in sql format)
Create databases with a table containing 6 columns for each motor


It is assumed that the link between the data and the interface is done, and the client chooses the degree of slider
  It is automatically saved in databases after pressing the save button
  But I had a lot of problems and I couldn't connect
